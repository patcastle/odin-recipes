# odin-recipes
As part of The Odin Project I'm to create a quick and dirty recipe website that includes:

- The homepage (index.html) with an ordered list that links out to
- Three recipe pages with an image, description, ingredient list as an unordered list, step-by-step instructions as an ordered list

The goal is to get the fingers accustomed to writing the boiler plate HTML code. There are no styling requirements in this project. It's just pure content and HTML tags. Nothing else.
