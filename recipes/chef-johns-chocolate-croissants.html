    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>Chef John’s Chocolate Croissants are a labor of love that will reward you with bakery-quality pastries from your own kitchen. This recipe blends careful lamination techniques with rich, bittersweet chocolate to create a croissant that’s crispy on the outside and tender on the inside. While the process may take a few hours, including chilling and layering, the result is flaky, buttery goodness with layers that shatter beautifully. The method Chef John uses is a quicker version that skips the usual overnight rest, making it more accessible to home bakers who are eager to enjoy fresh croissants in less time.</p>
    <p>To make these croissants, start by creating a rich, buttery dough that is carefully rolled and folded to achieve perfect layers. After chilling and laminating with butter, the dough is filled with chopped bittersweet chocolate, rolled into classic croissant shapes, and brushed with an egg wash. The final result, baked to golden perfection and lightly sprinkled with sea salt, is both impressive and indulgent. Whether for a special occasion or a weekend baking project, Chef John’s Chocolate Croissants are sure to impress with their authentic taste and texture.</p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>½ cup warm water (100°F or 38°C)</li>
      <li>½ (.25 ounce) package active dry yeast</li>
      <li>2 tablespoons granulated white sugar</li>
      <li>1 ¾ cups unbleached bread flour</li>
      <li>1 ½ teaspoons kosher salt</li>
      <li>3 tablespoons butter, room temperature, cut into pieces</li>
      <li>1 stick unsalted European-style butter</li>
      <li>1 cup chopped bittersweet chocolate</li>
      <li>1 egg</li>
      <li>1 tablespoon water</li>
      <li>1 pinch coarse sea salt, to taste</li>
    </ul>       
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
      <li>Place warm water in the bowl of a stand mixer and sprinkle with yeast. Let dissolve for 10 minutes.</li>
      <li>Add sugar and bread flour to the bowl, then sprinkle with salt and add 3 tablespoons butter. Attach the dough hook and mix until a smooth dough forms, about 3-4 minutes.</li>
      <li>Transfer dough to a work surface, form into a ball, return to the bowl, cover, and let rise in a warm spot until doubled, about 2 hours.</li>
      <li>Transfer dough to a floured surface, deflate, and shape into a rectangle. Fold into thirds, wrap in plastic wrap, and refrigerate for 1 hour.</li>
      <li>Cut 1 stick of butter in half lengthwise and place on parchment paper. Fold the parchment over and roll into an 8x8 inch square. Refrigerate until slightly chilled, about 10-15 minutes.</li>
      <li>Roll dough into a rectangle slightly larger than the butter slab. Place butter on one half of the dough, fold the other half over, and press with a rolling pin to create ridges.</li>
      <li>Roll out the dough until it’s the same size as before folding. Fold into thirds again, wrap, and refrigerate for 30 minutes.</li>
      <li>Repeat pressing and rolling, then fold into thirds again. Wrap and refrigerate for 15 minutes.</li>
      <li>Roll dough into a large rectangle, fold in half, and roll to 1/2-inch thickness.</li>
      <li>Roll dough to about 1/8-inch thickness and cut lengthwise into 6 pieces.</li>
      <li>Stretch one piece, add chocolate near one end, and roll into a croissant shape with the seam on the bottom. Repeat for remaining pieces.</li>
      <li>Place croissants on baking sheets lined with silicone mats, brush with egg wash, and let rise in a warm place for 60-90 minutes.</li>
      <li>Preheat oven to 400°F (200°C). Brush croissants with egg wash again, sprinkle with sea salt, and bake until golden brown, about 25 minutes.</li>
      <li>Transfer to a cooling rack and let cool to room temperature before serving.</li>
    </ol>
