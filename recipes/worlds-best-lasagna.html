    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>The "World's Best Lasagna" recipe has been an internet sensation for over two decades, attracting millions of views annually and maintaining a top spot on Allrecipes since its submission by John Chandler. This lasagna is famous for its hearty, meaty sauce made with a combination of sweet Italian sausage and lean ground beef, simmered to perfection with crushed tomatoes, tomato paste, and a medley of spices. Paired with layers of tender lasagna noodles and a rich blend of ricotta, mozzarella, and Parmesan cheeses, it’s a dish that requires a bit of patience but promises mouthwatering results. John’s creation has not only become a household favorite but has also touched hearts, creating a lasting legacy after his untimely passing.</p>
    <p>Despite its reputation as a time-intensive dish, the process is straightforward, with each step contributing to its indulgent taste and texture. After cooking the flavorful meat sauce and boiling the noodles, you'll build the lasagna layer by layer, alternating between sauce, ricotta mixture, and mozzarella cheese. Baked until golden and bubbling, this lasagna is then left to rest before serving, allowing the flavors to meld beautifully. With options for customizing the ingredients and detailed instructions for freezing and reheating, this classic lasagna fits perfectly into busy schedules or special occasions alike, offering a comforting and satisfying meal every time.</p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>

        <li>1 pound sweet Italian sausage</li>
        <li>¾ pound lean ground beef</li>
        <li>½ cup minced onion</li>
        <li>2 cloves garlic, crushed</li>
        <li>1 (28 ounce) can crushed tomatoes</li>
        <li>2 (6.5 ounce) cans canned tomato sauce</li>
        <li>2 (6 ounce) cans tomato paste</li>
        <li>½ cup water</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons white sugar</li>
        <li>4 tablespoons chopped fresh parsley, divided</li>
        <li>1 ½ teaspoons dried basil leaves</li>
        <li>1 ½ teaspoons salt, divided, or to taste</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon Italian seasoning</li>
        <li>½ teaspoon fennel seeds</li>
        <li>¼ teaspoon ground black pepper</li>
        <li>12 lasagna noodles</li>
        <li>16 ounces ricotta cheese</li>
        <li>1 egg</li>
        <li>¾ pound mozzarella cheese, sliced</li>
        <li>¾ cup grated Parmesan cheese</li>
      </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>In a Dutch oven over medium heat, cook the sausage, ground beef, onion, and garlic until well browned.</li>
        <li>Stir in crushed tomatoes, tomato sauce, tomato paste, and water. Season with sugar, 2 tablespoons of parsley, basil, 1 teaspoon of salt, Italian seasoning, fennel seeds, and black pepper. Simmer, covered, for about 1 ½ hours, stirring occasionally.</li>
        <li>Bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil. Cook lasagna noodles in boiling water for 8 to 10 minutes. Drain noodles and rinse with cold water.</li>
        <li>In a mixing bowl, combine ricotta cheese with the egg, remaining 2 tablespoons of parsley, and ½ teaspoon salt.</li>
        <li>Preheat the oven to 375°F (190°C).</li>
        <li>To assemble, spread 1 ½ cups of meat sauce in the bottom of a 9x13-inch baking dish. Arrange 6 noodles lengthwise over the meat sauce, overlapping slightly. Spread with ½ of the ricotta cheese mixture. Top with ⅓ of the mozzarella cheese slices. Spoon 1 ½ cups of meat sauce over the mozzarella, and sprinkle with ¼ cup Parmesan cheese.</li>
        <li>Repeat the layers, then top with remaining mozzarella and Parmesan cheese.</li>
        <li>Cover with foil: to prevent sticking, either spray the foil with cooking spray or ensure the foil does not touch the cheese.</li>
        <li>Bake in the preheated oven for 25 minutes. Remove the foil and bake for an additional 25 minutes.</li>
        <li>Let the lasagna rest for 15 minutes before serving.</li>
      </ol>
